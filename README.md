# Product_Recommendation_System

**Recommendation System for Customer Purchases**

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this project is to create an effective recommendation system that understands the buying behavior of customers. Using the collaborative filtering algorithm, the system recommends products to customers based on their purchase history and similarities with other customers.

**Libraries Used:**

- **NumPy:** Utilized for efficient numerical operations and array manipulations.
- **Pandas:** Essential for data manipulation, structuring, and analysis.
- **SciPy:** Employed for sparse matrix operations, particularly for calculating cosine similarities.
- **CategoricalDtype:** A Pandas function utilized for categorical data type conversion.
- **DataFrame:** A fundamental Pandas function used for creating and manipulating data frames.

**Project Workflow:**

**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**

   - **Data Source:** The sales data is loaded from the 'sales.xlsx' file, containing essential columns such as 'SalesItem,' 'SalesAmount,' and 'Customer.'
   - **Data Selection:** Relevant columns ('SalesItem', 'SalesAmount', 'Customer') are selected for analysis and recommendation generation.

**2. Data Preparation and Sparse Matrix Creation:**

   - **Binary Matrix:** The data is transformed into a binary matrix format, indicating whether a customer has purchased a specific item (1 for purchased, 0 for not purchased).
   - **Sparse Matrix:** Using sparse matrices, the data is structured into a matrix where rows represent customers, columns represent sales items, and matrix elements denote purchase quantities.

**3. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:**

   - **Similarity Calculation:** Cosine similarity scores are computed between sales items, establishing similarities based on purchase patterns.
   - **Nearest Neighbors:** For each sales item, the nearest neighbors (similar items) are identified. This step forms the foundation for generating recommendations.
   - **Placeholder Matrix:** A matrix is created to store similarities between customers and items, preparing for further computations.

**4. Recommendation Generation:**

   - **Similarity Score Calculation:** A function evaluates similarity scores based on customers' purchase history and item similarities. This function calculates personalized recommendations for each customer.
   - **Top Recommendations:** The top recommended sales items for each customer are determined and stored in the 'CustItemRecommend' DataFrame.

**5. Result and Impact:**

   - **Personalized Recommendations:** The 'CustItemRecommend' DataFrame contains tailored product recommendations for individual customers. These recommendations are based on their purchase history and patterns, enhancing the chances of customer satisfaction and retention.
   - **Business Impact:** By understanding customer preferences and suggesting relevant products, businesses can significantly enhance customer engagement, leading to increased sales and improved customer loyalty.

This recommendation system empowers businesses to cater to individual customer needs effectively, driving higher customer satisfaction and ultimately contributing to the growth and success of the business.
